# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 21st October, 2024

**Today's Progress**: I set up a sandbox and played around with basic animations. I learned the animation shorthand, the four basic transforms (rotate, scale, translate, and skew), and some timing functions. I also had an "a-hah!" moment regarding how transform values work; they're relative to the starting position of the element, not per keyframe.

**Reflections:** CSS is more entertaining than I thought, especially when using VSCode to preview and alter my animations on the fly. Next, I'd like to try and blend these animations together.

### Day 2: 22nd October, 2024

**Today's Progress**: I refactored my single page in preparation for more days, turning it into a homepage with nav links. I mainly experimented with combining and layering properties to create a more complex animation, which I'm pretty chuffed with. 

**Reflections:** I initially wrote off vanilla CSS animations as something not worth learning, as "Tailwind will take care of it"; I'm glad I shook off that mentality. I've learned a lot already, and I'm excited to learn even more. My actual design skills need some work, though! So tacky!
