# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 21st October, 2024

**Today's Progress**: I set up a sandbox and played around with basic animations. I learned the animation shorthand, the four basic transforms (rotate, scale, translate, and skew), and some timing functions. I also had an "a-hah!" moment regarding how transform values work; they're relative to the starting position of the element, not per keyframe.

**Reflections:** It's more entertaining than I thought, especially when using VSCode to preview and alter my animations on the fly. Next, I'd like to try and blend these animations together.
