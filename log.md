# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 21st October, 2024

**Today's Progress:** I set up a sandbox and played around with basic animations. I learned the animation shorthand, the four basic transforms (rotate, scale, translate, and skew), and some timing functions. I also had an "a-hah!" moment regarding how transform values work; they're relative to the starting position of the element, not per keyframe.

**Reflections:** CSS is more entertaining than I thought, especially when using VSCode to preview and alter my animations on the fly. Next, I'd like to try and blend these animations together.

### Day 2: 22nd October, 2024

**Today's Progress:** I refactored my single page in preparation for more days, turning it into a homepage with nav links. I mainly experimented with combining and layering properties to create a more complex animation, which I'm pretty chuffed with. 

**Reflections:** I initially wrote off vanilla CSS animations as something not worth learning, as "Tailwind will take care of it"; I'm glad I shook off that mentality. I've learned a lot already, and I'm excited to learn even more. My actual design skills need some work, though! So tacky!

### Day 3: 23rd October, 2024

**Today's Progress:** I made a lot of progress today. My project has been refactored once again, this time by placing my .css and .html files in folders. I thought it'd be the best course of action, as I need to learn how to modularise my code and stay organised if I want to learn React and its component structure. I struggled with linking all my stylesheets and webpages together until I discovered "../", which moves the pathing up a directory. I learned about transitions, which are simple yet pretty limited, and also the BÃ©zier curve, which is fun to play around with. Next, I'd like to find a way of making interesting shapes, as I only know how to create basic circles, squares, and rectangles.

**Reflections:** It goes without saying that planning out the structure of a project is the most important step. Redoing the hierarchy of all my files and folders was a bit of a pain, so I can't even imagine how tedious it would be for a larger, more intricate project. Also, vanilla CSS continues to surprise me with how flexible and expansive it is without needing any libraries or frameworks.

### Day 4: 24th October, 2024

**Today's Progress:** I explored the "clip-path:" property and touched up the responsiveness of my project pages a bit. Slow day, but I'm letting everything sink right in.

**Reflections:** "clip-path:" is powerful, but finicky; especially "clip-path: polygon()"; you pretty much need to use a visual representation of the vertices in order to use it effectively, such as a premade .svg image or a generator like Clippy. From browsing around, I saw that "Canvas API" is the preferred method for drawing shapes, but it requires JavaScript. I suppose in terms of pure CSS, "clip-path" is the best option for complex shapes. It already feels like I'm close to learning all I need to learn for intermediate / advanced CSS, so I'm going to begin React next week.
